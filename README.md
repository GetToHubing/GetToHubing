Hello! I just started my journey on becoming a web developer. As of right now (5/12/22) I am only a beginner in HTML and CSS but I plan to build that up and also learn JavaScript in the very near future. After that...well i'll see what my options are and go from there. Right now though I just want to start actually building while i'm learning since I learn best by doing. I'll also be learning how to use Git and Github at the same time as everything else; hopefully that isn't a mistake. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
